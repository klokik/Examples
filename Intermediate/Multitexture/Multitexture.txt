:Title:
Multitexture

:ShortDescription:
This training course is an example of how to combine multiple textures.

:FullDescription:
This training course demonstrates how to combine multiple textures in six different ways using glTexEnvf(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_COMBINE_RGB, param).  Param can be any of:
	-	GL_MODULATE	-	When applying the textures multiply the colours in the first by the colours in the second.
	-	GL_ADD	-	Add the colours of the two textures together to get the final colour.
	-	GL_ADD_SIGNED	-	Add the colours of the two textures together and minus 0.5 to get the final colour.
	-	GL_REPLACE	-	Just use the first texture for texturing.
	-	GL_SUBTRACT	-	Subtract the colours of the second texture from the first.
	-	GL_DOT3_RGB	-	Combine the first texture (the normal map) with the second texture (the colour map).

Controls:
	-	Esc	-	Close the application
