:Title:
AntialiasedLines

:ShortDescription:
This training course demonstrates how to render antialiased lines without enabling full screen anti-aliasing.

:FullDescription:
Full screen antialiasing can be too expensive or unavailable on some platforms, but it is possible to render smooth lines without it.  This training course shows how to render anti-aliased lines with round caps using texture filtering and blending.  This is done by drawing each line as a polygon of six triangles.

Eight vertices are written to a vertex array; the rectangles (0,1,2,3) and (4,5,6,7) represent the round line caps. The rectangle (2,3,4,5) is the main line segment.

Note that for this example the caps are entirely between the end points. Even vertices are displaced along the positive normal (+n), odd vertices are displaced along the negative normal.  The pairs (2, 3) and (4, 5) are shifted inwards along the line tangent.

To achieve antialiasing, a special texture is used where an opaque segment exists from 0 to 0.5 on the U-axis. -0.25 is used as the texture coordinate for the even vertices and 0.75 for the odd vertices. This is necessary so that the effect still looks good when the 2 texel wide mip level is used. The GL_REPEAT texture wrap mode makes sure the transparent part on the right side of the texture is repeated to the left of the line/opaque part.  Texture filtering and blending then results in smooth lines.

The method breaks down when the line geometry becomes less than 2 pixels wide (actual line width < 1). In this case the line width should be clamped to 1 and  the actual line width used as an alpha factor, so very thin lines will smoothly fade out.
